# EMG Sensor
An electromyogram (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles at rest and during contraction.
          
EMG signals are used in many clinical and biomedical applications. EMG is used as a diagnostics tool for identifying neuromuscular diseases, assessing low-back pain, kinesiology, and disorders of motor control. EMG signals are also used as a control signal for prosthetic devices such as prosthetic hands, arms, and lower limbs.          
This sensor will measure the filtered and rectified electrical activity of a muscle, depending the amount of activity in the selected muscle.       


Use your muscles to control any type of actuator (motors, servos, lights ...). Interact with the environment with your own muscles.
This sensor comes with everything you need to start sensing muscle activity with your Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
